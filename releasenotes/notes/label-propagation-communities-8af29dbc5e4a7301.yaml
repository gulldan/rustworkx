    Added a new function, :func:`~rustworkx.label_propagation_communities`, that 
    implements a semi-synchronous label propagation algorithm for community 
    detection in undirected graphs. This algorithm is based on the paper 
    "Community Detection via Semi-Synchronous Label Propagation Algorithms" 
    by Cordasco and Gargano (2010). The function takes a :class:`~rustworkx.PyGraph` 
    as input and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the 
    node indices of a community.
